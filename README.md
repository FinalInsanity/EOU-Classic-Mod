A fix for Tildehat's wonderful EOU Classic Mod that adds the ability to make generic Highlanders and Gunners in Classic mode as well as access Gladsheim.
These replace the original files to fix image formatting and the Landsknecht Custom-menu mini-portrait issue.
I can claim no credit for the work Tildehat put into making the mod in the first place, and all your praise and gratitude should go to them.

Original readme:

# EOU Classic Mod
 Allows the creation of Gunner and Highlander classes in classic mode and allows traversal through Gladsheim 


This only works on the North American version of EOU

This mod allows you to create Highlanders and Gunners in EOU without the need of reclassing. This also allows access to Gladsheim in Classic mode.

Gladsheim areas can be access through a series of quest after reaching a new Geomagnetic pole. Accepting the quest will allow you to teleport to the Gladsheim area and Story mode events in Gladsheim will occur.
