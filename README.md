A fix for Tildehat's wonderful EOU Classic Mod that adds the ability to make generic Highlanders and Gunners in Classic mode as well as access Gladsheim.

You can find the necessary files in the Releases section.

I can claim no credit for the work Tildehat put into making the mod in the first place, all I did was make a few fixes.

Original readme:

# EOU Classic Mod
 Allows the creation of Gunner and Highlander classes in classic mode and allows traversal through Gladsheim 


This only works on the North American version of EOU

This mod allows you to create Highlanders and Gunners in EOU without the need of reclassing. This also allows access to Gladsheim in Classic mode.

Gladsheim areas can be access through a series of quest after reaching a new Geomagnetic pole. Accepting the quest will allow you to teleport to the Gladsheim area and Story mode events in Gladsheim will occur.
