A fix for Tildehat's wonderful Etrian Odyssey Untold Classic Mod that adds the ability to make generic Highlanders and Gunners in Classic mode as well as access Gladsheim. The original's release zip contained an outdated code.ips file which caused a few small problems with Landsknecht's mini portraits. I've fixed things so that it is now properly updated, as well as fixing the image formatting for the Highlander and Gunner minis.

You can find the updated files in the Releases section.

I can claim no credit for the work Tildehat put into making this mod in the first place, all I did was make a few fixes.

Original readme:

# EOU Classic Mod
 Allows the creation of Gunner and Highlander classes in classic mode and allows traversal through Gladsheim 


This only works on the North American version of EOU

This mod allows you to create Highlanders and Gunners in EOU without the need of reclassing. This also allows access to Gladsheim in Classic mode.

Gladsheim areas can be access through a series of quest after reaching a new Geomagnetic pole. Accepting the quest will allow you to teleport to the Gladsheim area and Story mode events in Gladsheim will occur.
